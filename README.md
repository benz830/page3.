<b><h2><font color="orange"> What are the causes of Poberty?</B></h2></font>
<b><font color="white">We know that there are a huge number of causes of poverty, many of which are out of the hands of those who ultimately suffer. These include all of the following:
<br>• being born into poverty
<br>• suffering through domestic abuse which leads toliving in poverty due to the person not being in control of their incomes
<br>• someone losing their employment which is more of an issue at the moment due to the current COVID-19 crisis. The end of the furlough schemeat the end of October 2020 could result in a
<br>large number of job losses
<br>• losing everything due to a partner gambling away the family income and savings
<br>• being pressurised into supporting others due to emotional ties leading to debt or increased debt
<br>and potentially the loss of their home</b></font></br>
<br><b><h2><font color="yellow"> What are the effect of Poberty? </b></h2><font>
<font color="white"><b>• The levels of stress that each person is under,greatly increases. They cannot concentrate at work, leading to issues with their performance which can then lead to 
<br>fears about losing their job.
<br>• They become socially isolated due to not having any spare funds to join in any social events or activities (e.g. lunch with friends, going to the pub, visiting relatives who don’t stay nearby).
<br>People may perceive them as not wanting to engage at the very time when they need support the most.
<br>• People may be tempted to turn to crime toprovide for their family - “Poverty is the mother of all crime”.
<br>• Parents go without food and essentials to makesure that their children and those they support are able to have what they need.
<br>• Children and young people are bullied at schooldue to not having the newest phone, or sports gear or laptops / mobile devices.
<br>• Life becomes so much of a struggle that oftenthe only way to escape can be suicide.
<br>• Poverty has negative impacts on children'shealth, social, emotional and cognitive development, behaviour and educationaloutcomes. Children born into poverty are more
<br>likely to experience a wide range of healthproblems, including poor nutrition, chronic disease and mental health problems <font></b>
